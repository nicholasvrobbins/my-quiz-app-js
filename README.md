Following along with Florin Pop (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtKciwk_si4) creating a Countdown Timer utilizing JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I didn't necesarily 'learn' anything new from this tutorial, but being able to practice more JavaScript projects is very helpful. Going through the FCC JavaScript courses is great, but I feel a lack of projects keeps me wondering when and how am I going to use these things so utilizing some of what I've learned by building projects is very helpful.
