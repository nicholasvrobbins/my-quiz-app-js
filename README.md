Following along with Florin Pop (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtKciwk_si4) creating a basic Quiz App utilizing JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This one utilized an array with the data which was cool to navigate and use more of, getting very comfortable using document.many-different-things and creating them as a variable. It's been eye opening learning basic algorithms and scripts in FCC's JS course and seeing them implemented over here with creating functions with if statements, using forEach, calling functions within other functions, etc., really enjoyed this project even though it wasn't that extensive and I think it would be cool to have the questions randomize and have the answers randomize their place so you can't memorize the direct answer. Overall a cool project!
